      <p>He is generally credited as the inventor of the Java programming language in 1991.<br> He did the original design of Java and implemented its original compiler and virtual machine. For this achievement he was elected to the United States National Academy of Engineering.<br> He has also made major contributions to several other software systems, such as NeWS and Gosling Emacs. <br>He also cowrote the "bundle" program, a utility thoroughly detailed in Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike's book The Unix Programming Environment.</p>
